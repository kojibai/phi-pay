# KRC-0 — Krystal Registry (URL-list)

KRC-0 defines the minimal **Memory Crystal** registry format.

It is intentionally small: a KRC-0 file is a JSON object containing a single field:

- `urls`: an array of KRL strings

This format is sufficient to carry an entire library as one portable artifact.

---

## File format

A KRC-0 file MUST be valid JSON and MUST conform to:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "…KRL string…",
    "…KRL string…"
  ]
}
```

### Requirements

- `urls` MUST be present.
- `urls` MUST be an array.
- Each element of `urls` MUST be a string.
- The order of `urls` entries MUST be preserved by readers and writers.

### Append-only rule

A KRC-0 registry SHOULD be treated as an **append-only log**:

- To add new records: append new KRL strings to the end of `urls`.
- To correct or supersede a record: append a new record that references the prior record (e.g. via `parentUrl`), rather than rewriting history.

KRC-0 does not forbid duplicates, but producers SHOULD avoid accidental duplication.

---

## Verification

A conforming verifier MUST:

1. Parse the JSON.
2. For each URL string:
   - Attempt KRL-1.0 decoding.
   - If a `pulse` and `(beat, stepIndex)` are present, verify they match KKS-1.0 derivation.
