# KHS-1 — Hashing

KHS-1 defines the hashing rules used for content addressing.

---

## Algorithm

- Hash algorithm: **SHA-256**
- Digest length: 32 bytes
- Text encoding: lowercase hex (64 chars)

---

## Artifact hash

For a binary artifact with raw bytes `B`:

`artifactHash = sha256(B)` encoded as 64 lowercase hex characters.

This hash MAY be used in content locators such as:

`/s/{artifactHash}`

---

## JSON object hash

For a JSON object `O`:

1. Compute canonical bytes: `C = KCS1(O)`
2. Compute digest: `H = sha256(C)`
3. Encode: `objectHash = hex_lower(H)`

---

## Collision resistance

SHA-256 is collision resistant for all practical purposes. Krystal treats equal hashes as equal content.
